# about
When translating, it is useful to search multiple dictionaries to get a wide array of matching terms. This is essential when translating Japanese, as words can have a number of different corresponding meanings in English. This app searches three separate Japanese-English dictionaries in one search, saving time, effort, and overlap. I used axios to send the search term to each of the dictionaries and cheerio to extract the results from the returned data. The results are animated with GSAP and displayed in modals. The animated background displays images returned from the Unsplash API.
