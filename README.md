# about
This app searches three separate Japanese-English dictionaries in one search, saving time, effort, and overlap. It uses axios to pass the search term as a query param to each of the dictionary URLs and cheerio to extract the results from the returned data. The results are animated with GSAP and displayed in modals. The animated background displays images returned from the Unsplash API.
